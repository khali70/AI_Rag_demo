# Project Documentation

This directory contains deeper dives into the two main apps in the repository.

- [Backend](backend.md) – FastAPI service that ingests documents, embeds them, and serves the RAG API.
- [Frontend](frontend.md) – Next.js dashboard for uploading files and chatting with the assistant.

Use these docs when onboarding new contributors or planning deployments.
